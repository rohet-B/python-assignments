## Data Collection
### Data can be collected from multiple different sources.
 1. **Primary Data Sources**
    - Data collected by the individual or organisation for a specific purpose.

    - Primary Data Sources are expensive but we have more control over the data.
    - Examples: 
        - *Sensors & Devices* - Iot Devices (sensors, smart devices), health wearables etc. 
        
        - *Surveys & Forms* - Customer Satisfaction, feedback etc. Tools like google forms etc can be used.
        - *Interviews*, *Questionnaires*, *experiments & Observations*.
 2. **Secondary Data Sources**
    - Data that has already been collected and processed by others.

    - Secondary Data Sources are cheaper but we have less control over data quality and format. 
    - Examples: 
        - *Databases* - SQL & NoSQL Databases.

        - *Public Datasets* - Kaggle, UCI (University of California) ML Repo etc.
        - *API* - Twitter API, Stock API, Weather API etc.
        - *Web Scraping* - Extracting information from web pages (HTML pages), blogs/articles, social meida pages etc.
            - Note: We cannot scrape data from any website freely. We must follow the website’s terms of service, robots.txt rules and data usage guidelines to check whether data collection is allowed or not.
3. **System Generated Data**
    - Data automatically generated by systems, applications, or machines during normal operations.

    - Examples - logs, video feeds, synthetic data etc.

## Starting with SQL using MySQL Database
- If you encounter the error “mysql is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file” while running MySQL from the command prompt.
- Consider this MySQL [video](https://youtu.be/_b3bgMhzxYY?si=P2s_AySJUuQa7Uap).
### What is Database?
- It is a collection of data in a format that can be easily accessed.
### What is DBMS?
- A DBMS is created by adding a management layer over a database.

- The Management System (MS) allow users to communicate with database using SQL (Structured Query Language), It means it works like an interface between user and database.
- A DBMS is software designed to handle data storage, manipulation and retrieval in an organized manner.
### SQL (Structured Query Language)
- SQL is a database query language used to interact with relational databases.

### SQL Vs NoSQL
- SQL
    1. Relational Database (data stored in Tables)
    
    2. Example: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL etc.
- NoSQL
    1. Non Relational Database (data stored in document/key-value pairs/graphs etc)

    2. Example: MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j etc.

### What is Database in MySQL?
- A database in MySQL is an organized collection of data stored in the form of `tables`, where data can be easily stored, managed and retrieved using SQL.
### In MySQL, columns and rows have specific names
- Column => Field & Attribute

- Row => Record & Tuple
### Connecting VsCode with MySQL
- Refer to this [video](https://youtu.be/FuSxGqWacd0?si=a3GYs18h9cns-4-r).
### Database Queries:
1. `CREATE DATABASE db_name;` OR `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name;`

2. `DROP DATABASE db_name;` OR `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db_name;`
3. `CREATE TABLE table_name(column_name1 datatype constraint,column_name2 datatype constraint,);` -> Creates Table or Schema (structure) of the table.

### CHAR Vs VARCHAR
1. `CHAR` is a fixed-length data type, which means it always uses the same amount of storage space, even if the actual value is shorter. For example, if `CHAR(10)` is used to store the value "ABC", the database will still allocate 10 characters and fill the remaining space with blank spaces. This makes CHAR slightly faster but can `waste` memory.

2. On the other hand, `VARCHAR` is a variable-length data type, so it only uses the space required to store the actual data. If `VARCHAR(10)` stores "ABC", it will use only 3 characters. Because of this, VARCHAR is more `memory-efficient` and is commonly used for values like names, emails and addresses where the length can change.

### `UNSIGNED` Datatype
- In databases (like MySQL), UNSIGNED means a number cannot be negative.

- Normally, numeric data types can store both negative and positive values. When you add `UNSIGNED`, the column stores only zero and positive numbers.
- For example, an `INT` column can store values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. But an `INT UNSIGNED` column can store values from 0 to 4,294,967,295. Since negative numbers are not allowed, the space that was used for negatives is used to store bigger positive numbers instead.

### What are Constraints?
- Constraints in MySQL are rules applied to table columns to make sure the data stored in the database is correct, valid and consistent.
- Types of Constraints in MySQL:
    1. `NOT NULL` - Ensures that a column cannot have NULL (empty) values.

    2. `UNIQUE` - Ensures that all values in a column are different.
    3. `PRIMARY KEY` - Combines NOT NULL + UNIQUE, Uniquely identifies each record in a table, Only one primary key per table
        - SYNTAX: `CREATE TABLE table_name(ID INT PRIMARY KEY,NAME VARCHAR(30));` OR
        - `CREATE TABLE table_name(ID INT,NAME VARCHAR(50),PRIMARY KEY(ID));`
    4. `FOREIGN KEY` - Creates a relationship between two tables, `FOREIGN KEY` is a column in one table that refers to the `PRIMARY KEY` of another table, `FOREIGN KEY` can have duplicate & null values, There can be multiple `FOREIGN KEYS` in a table.
        - SYNTAX: `CREATE TABLE table_name(CUSTOMER_ID INT,FOREIGN KEY (CUSTOMER_ID) REFERENCES another_TABLE_name(ID));`
    5. `CHECK` - Ensures that values meet a specific condition.
        - SYNTAX: `CONSTRAINT constraint_name CHECK (col_name >= 13);`
        - Keep in mind `constraint_name` is optional.
    6. `DEFAULT` - Sets a default value if no value is provided.
        - SYNTAX: `CREATE TABLE USER(ID INT,FOLLOWERS INT DEFAULT 0);`
    7. `AUTO_INCREMENT` - Automatically increases numeric values (usually for IDs).

### `INSERT` SYNTAX - Order of values must match column list order.
- SYNTAX: 
    - `INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (Column1_Value1, Column2_Value1, Column3_Value1),(column1_value2,column2_value2,column3_value2);`

    - OR
    - `INSERT INTO table_name (COL1, COL2, COL3) VALUES (column1_value1, column2_value1, column3_value1),(column1_value2, column2_value2, column3_value2);`
- `Note:` The `INSERT` statement without a column list is useful when inserting multiple rows at once and when values are provided for all columns in the table in the correct order. For all other cases—such as inserting selected columns, using `DEFAULT` or `AUTO_INCREMENT` values by skipping columns-the column list should be used.

### CLAUSE - part of a SQL statement that performs a specific task.
1. `SELECT` 
    - `SELECT` is used to select & show data from the table.

    - SYNTAX:
        1. `SELECT col1,col2 FROM table_name;`

        2. `SELECT * FROM table_name;`
2. `WHERE`
    - `WHERE` is used to define conditions.
    
    - SYNTAX:
        1. `SELECT col1,col2 FROM table_name WHERE conditions;`
    - Operators used with `WHERE` Clause:
        1. Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (Modulus)

        2. Comparison Operators: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<` ,`<=`
        3. Logical Operators: 
            - `AND`, `OR` 

            - `NOT` - Negate the given condition.
                - `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE col_name NOT IN("val1","val2");`
            - `IN` - Matches any value in the list.
                - `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE EMAIL IN ("val1","val2","val3");`
            - `BETWEEN` - `BETWEEN` is used to select values within a specified range and it uses the `AND` operator to define the lower and upper limits.
            - `ALL` - Compare a value with a set of values returned by a subquery. The condition becomes true only if the comparison is true for every value in that set.
                - `SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks > ALL (SELECT marks FROM topper);`
            - `LIKE` - Used to search for a pattern in a column, it uses wildcard characters `%` - it means multiple characters and `_` - it means single character.
                - `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE EMAIL LIKE "R%";`
            - `ANY` - Compare a value with a set of values returned by a subquery. The condition becomes true if the comparison is true for at least one value in that set.
                - `SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks > ANY (SELECT marks FROM topper);`
        4. Bitwise Operators: `&` (Bitwise AND), `|` (Bitwise OR)

### KEYWORDS 
1. `DISTINCT`
    - `DISTINCT` is a keyword used with `SELECT` to remove duplicate values from the result.
    - Syntax:
        `SELECT DISTINCT col_name FROM table_name;`
