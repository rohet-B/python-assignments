## Steps Involved In Data Science
1. **Define the problem**
    - Clearly understand what problem needs to be solved and what outcome is expected.
2. **Data Collection**
    - Gather data from different sources such as databases, files, surveys, APIs, websites using web scraping techniques.
3. **Basic Data Cleaning** 
    - We load the data & structure it by cleaning the data i.e removing duplicate data & fixing data types. 
4. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
    - Analyze the data to understand patterns, trends and relationships using statistics and visualizations.
5. **Advanced Data Cleaning & Pre-processing**
    - Remove errors, handle missing values, remove duplicates and convert data into a usable format.
6. **Feature Engineering**
    - Select, modify or create new features that help improve the Machine Learning model’s performance.
7. **Modeling**
    - Choose suitable machine learning algorithms and train the model using the prepared data.
8. **Evaluation**
    - Test the model using evaluation metrics to check accuracy and performance.
9. **Deployment**
    - Deploy the trained model into a real-world environment so users or applications can use it.

### In this Part we will start with EDA.
- After collecting data we don't just start with making machine learning models instead we first clean the data & then analys the cleaned data.
- For this:
    1. We first generate statistical summary from the cleaned data and then we create visualizations from it.
    2. Once done, We analyse data to find out patterns, structures, trends and many other things.

### Now to perform EDA, we will use Pandas
- Pandas is a Python library used for data analysis and data manipulation.
- Pandas helps us store, clean, analyze and manipulate data easily using tables (rows and columns).
