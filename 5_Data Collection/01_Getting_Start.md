## Data Collection
### Data can be collected from multiple different sources.
 1. **Primary Data Sources**
    - Data collected by the individual or organisation for a specific purpose.

    - Primary Data Sources are expensive but we have more control over the data.
    - Examples: 
        - *Sensors & Devices* - Iot Devices (sensors, smart devices), health wearables etc. 
        
        - *Surveys & Forms* - Customer Satisfaction, feedback etc. Tools like google forms etc can be used.
        - *Interviews*, *Questionnaires*, *experiments & Observations*.
 2. **Secondary Data Sources**
    - Data that has already been collected and processed by others.

    - Secondary Data Sources are cheaper but we have less control over data quality and format. 
    - Examples: 
        - *Databases* - SQL & NoSQL Databases.

        - *Public Datasets* - Kaggle, UCI (University of California) ML Repo etc.
        - *API* - Twitter API, Stock API, Weather API etc.
        - *Web Scraping* - Extracting information from web pages (HTML pages), blogs/articles, social meida pages etc.
            - Note: We cannot scrape data from any website freely. We must follow the website’s terms of service, robots.txt rules and data usage guidelines to check whether data collection is allowed or not.
3. **System Generated Data**
    - Data automatically generated by systems, applications, or machines during normal operations.

    - Examples - logs, video feeds, synthetic data etc.

## Starting with SQL using MySQL Database
- If you encounter the error “mysql is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file” while running MySQL from the command prompt.
- Consider this MySQL [video](https://youtu.be/_b3bgMhzxYY?si=P2s_AySJUuQa7Uap).
### What is Database?
- It is a collection of data in a format that can be easily accessed.
### What is DBMS?
- A DBMS is created by adding a management layer over a database.

- The Management System (MS) allow users to communicate with database using SQL (Structured Query Language), It means it works like an interface between user and database.
- A DBMS is software designed to handle data storage, manipulation and retrieval in an organized manner.
### SQL (Structured Query Language)
- SQL is a database query language used to interact with relational databases.

### SQL Vs NoSQL
- SQL
    1. Relational Database (data stored in Tables)
    
    2. Example: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL etc.
- NoSQL
    1. Non Relational Database (data stored in document/key-value pairs/graphs etc)

    2. Example: MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j etc.

### What is Database in MySQL?
- A database in MySQL is an organized collection of data stored in the form of `tables`, where data can be easily stored, managed and retrieved using SQL.
### In MySQL, columns and rows have specific names
- Column => Field & Attribute

- Row => Record & Tuple
### Connecting VsCode with MySQL
- Refer to this [video](https://youtu.be/FuSxGqWacd0?si=a3GYs18h9cns-4-r).
### Database Queries:
1. `CREATE DATABASE db_name;` OR `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name;`

2. `DROP DATABASE db_name;` OR `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db_name;`
3. `CREATE TABLE table_name(column_name1 datatype constraint,column_name2 datatype constraint,);` -> Creates Table or Schema (structure) of the table.

### CHAR Vs VARCHAR
1. `CHAR` is a fixed-length data type, which means it always uses the same amount of storage space, even if the actual value is shorter. For example, if `CHAR(10)` is used to store the value "ABC", the database will still allocate 10 characters and fill the remaining space with blank spaces. This makes CHAR slightly faster but can `waste` memory.

2. On the other hand, `VARCHAR` is a variable-length data type, so it only uses the space required to store the actual data. If `VARCHAR(10)` stores "ABC", it will use only 3 characters. Because of this, VARCHAR is more `memory-efficient` and is commonly used for values like names, emails and addresses where the length can change.

### `UNSIGNED` Datatype
- In databases (like MySQL), UNSIGNED means a number cannot be negative.

- Normally, numeric data types can store both negative and positive values. When you add `UNSIGNED`, the column stores only zero and positive numbers.
- For example, an `INT` column can store values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. But an `INT UNSIGNED` column can store values from 0 to 4,294,967,295. Since negative numbers are not allowed, the space that was used for negatives is used to store bigger positive numbers instead.
